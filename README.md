# **Image Augmentation Validation using FID and KID**

## **Overview**
This project evaluates the quality of augmented images generated through data augmentation techniques by calculating **Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID)** and **Kernel Inception Distance (KID)**. These metrics compare the statistical similarity between the original images and augmented images using features extracted from the **InceptionV3 model**.

## **Key Features**
- Calculates FID and KID scores for augmented image datasets.
- Supports various augmentation methods (rotation, flipping, noise addition, etc.).
- Efficient feature extraction using the **InceptionV3 model**.
- Implements multiprocessing for faster feature extraction.
- Results indicate the fidelity and diversity of augmented images.
